Backup Script for backing up to amazon s3 from disk and mysql

Requires the following gems:

rio aws-s3 sequel inifile


Usage:

First, edit config/database.cnf and config/config.rb

config/database.cnf holds login information for mysql. 
If you specify the root password here, the script will backup all databases. 
If you specify just a user account, you must use the -s flag to specify databases to backup, e.g. ./wfbackup -s mydb1,mydb2

config/config.rb holds Amazon S3 configuration, as well as a list of directories to archive. 

./wfbackup.rb -h           Provides Help
